# Release the primary repository

Using Jenkins, run the appropriate release job, specifying 
the release and the next version (with -SNAPSHOT) suffix.

# Tag the examples repository

Once the release is available in central, checkout the
latest -examples repository and run, for correct value
of `2016.9`

    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2016.9

The build both regular and uberjar versions

    mvn clean && mvn install 

    mvn clean && mvn install -Puberjar

# Tag the documentation

* Edit the `book.json` to ensure all versions are correct,
including Keycloak, WildFly and WildFly Swarm itself.

* `git tag` the repository and `git push --tags`

* Wait for the tagged build to completely build and publish
on GitBooks.  Once we have a linkable build, re-edit
the `book.json` to the next `-SNAPSHOT` version of
WildFly Swarm, commit and push again.

= Elytron

Elytron can generate the audit log to the same directory where the {Thorntail} application is executed. Include the following section in the `project-defaults.yml` file in your application:

[source,text]
----
thorntail:
  elytron:
    file-audit-logs:
      local-audit:
        path: audit.log
----

In some environments, for example cloud, you might have to relocate the audit file to a globally writable directory, for example:

----
thorntail:
  elytron:
    file-audit-logs:
      local-audit:
        path: /tmp/audit.log
----

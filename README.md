# WildFly Swarm Core

WildFly Swarm provides a mechanism for building
applications as *uber jars*, with just enough of the
WildFly application server wrapped around it to support
each application's use-case.

> Note: WildFly Swarm requires Maven 3.2.5 or higher for building your application.

> Note: WildFly Swarm requires JDK 8 or higher for building your application
> or for building WildFly Swarm itself.

# Project Configuration

In a normal WAR-based maven `pom.xml`, simply add the following
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${version.wildfly-swarm}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>package</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>package</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

This will take the `.war` file normally created by your build, and wrap
it in the wildfly-swarm mechanisms.

If you normally produce `myapp-1.0.war`, in your `target/` directory will
then also be present a `myapp-1.0-swarm.jar`.

In order to specify the portions of the WildFly AS your application needs,
your `pom.xml` should specify some of the following dependencies within
the `org.wildfly.swarm` Maven group-id:

* bean-validation
* cdi
* ee
* io
* jaxrs
* logging
* naming
* request-controller
* security
* transactions
* undertow
* _and many more!_

# How To Build WildFly Swarm Itself

WildFly Swarm attempts to be a well-behaved Maven project. To install to your local repository for usage:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

If you're running short on time:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

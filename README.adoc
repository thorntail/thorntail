.Install the thorntail-maven-plugin

Until it is published, you'll need to clone the repository and install it using Maven.

    git clone git@github.com:bobmcwhirter/unimbus-plugins.git

    cd unimbus-plugins

    mvn install

.Build Thorntail-proper

The build assumes Docker is present in some cases for deeper integration tests.

You may skip all tests (and its Docker usage) using `-DskipTests`

    mvn clean && mvn install

.Build while running the various TCKs

By default the MicroProfile TCKs are _not_ included in the build.
To include them, simply add `-Ptck` to any `mvn` invocation:

    mvn clean -Ptck && mvn install -Ptck

= Configuring the JDBC driver manually

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* A Maven-based application.
* The `module.xml` file created in the `src/main/resources/modules` directory according to relevant {WildFly} instructions.
  This file is necessary to expose the driver through JBoss Modules.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Add the `io.thorntail:datasources` dependency to the `pom.xml` file in your application:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
    <artifactId>datasources</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

. Edit the `project-defaults.yml` file to define the driver information.
+
In the `thorntail` -> `datasources` -> `jdbc-drivers` tree, define the driver by
key, which will be used later for connecting it to the datasource.
Set the `driver-module-name` to that defined in the `module.xml`.
+
[source,yaml]

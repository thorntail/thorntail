= Creating a datasource

When working with Java applications, a _datasource_ has
two components, both equally important:

* The JDBC driver
* The datasource definition

The task of the JDBC driver is communicating with the database while providing
a constant API to application developers. An application must supply its own
JDBC driver because of the wide range of available databases and the driver
version. Usually, the application does not directly interact with the JDBC
driver; instead, the underlying runtime manages creating a datasource,
which provides an efficient way to share and manage a discrete connection or
a pool of connections to a particular database using the driver.

== Configuring a JDBC driver

Start with adding the following Maven dependency which uses an H2 datasource by default: 

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
  <artifactId>datasources</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There are two options how to configure JDBC drivers:

include::auto-detecting-jdbc-drivers.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

include::configuring-the-jdbc-driver-manually.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

include::configuring-a-datasource.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Example full project-defaults.yml file

Below, you can see an example `project-defaults` file that connect to an H2
database.

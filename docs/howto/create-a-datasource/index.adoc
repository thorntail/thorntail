= How to create a datasource

When working with Java applications, a datasource has
two components, both equally important:

. JDBC Driver
. Datasource Definition

The JDBC driver is responsible to knowing how to communicate
with the database, while providing a constant API to application
developers. An application must bring their own JDBC driver,
since the range of available databases and versions of each driver
is rather large.  Usually the application will not directly interact
with the JDBC driver.  Instead, the underlying runtime will manage
creating a _datasource_ which provides an efficient way to share
and manage a discrete connection (or pool of connections) to a
particular database using the driver.

## JDBC Drivers

### Auto-detection

WildFly Swarm has the capability to detect, install and register
a variety of JDBC drivers based on their inclusion as a dependency
to your application.

The currently detectable drivers include:

* H2
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* EnterpriseDB
* SQLServer
* Oracle
* Sybase
* DB2

Simply add the appropriate dependency (with the default `<scope>compile</scope>`
scope) to your application:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
include::{docdir}/pom.xml[tag=dependencies,indent=2]
</dependencies>
----

### Explicit JDBC Driver Configuration

In the event you need to provide customized driver configuration instead
of relying on the auto-detection, you can use `project-defaults.yml` to define
the driver information.  This presumes you've followed the normal WildFly
instructions for creating an appropriate `module.xml` to expose the 
driver through _JBoss Modules_.  This is completely unnecessary if you
rely upon the auto-detection mentioned above.

Underneath the tree of `swarm` -> `datasources` -> `jdbc-drivers`, you
can define the driver by key, which will be used later for connecting it
to a datasource.  

[source,yaml]
----
swarm:
  datasources:
    jdbc-drivers:
include::{docdir}/src/main/resources/project-defaults.yml[tag=driver,indent=6]
----

## Datasources

Once a driver has been configured, through either auto-detection or
explicit configuration, you can use `project-defaults.yml` to configure
one or more datasources using that driver, under `swarm` -> `datasources` -> `data-sources`:

[source,yaml]
----
swarm:
  datasources:
    data-sources:
include::{docdir}/src/main/resources/project-defaults.yml[tag=datasource,indent=6]
----

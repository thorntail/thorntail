= {Thorntail} community BOM types

{Thorntail} is described as _just enough app-server,_ which means it consists of multiple pieces.  Your application includes only the pieces it needs.

Over time, some of these pieces reach the _stable_ status, while some are classified as _unstable_ or _experimental._

When using {Thorntail}, you can specify the following Maven BOMs:

bom-all:: All fractions: stable, unstable, experimental, and even deprecated.

bom-deprecated:: Fractions that have been deprecated.

bom-experimental:: Fractions that are considered experimental, which means they can disappear or radically change between releases.

bom-unstable:: Fractions that do not change as often as the experimental ones.  However, unstable fractions can still change their behavior or contain bugs, even dangerous ones.

bom-stable or bom:: Fractions recommended for daily use.

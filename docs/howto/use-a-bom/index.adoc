= How to use a BOM

If you want to explicitly enumerate the WildFly Swarm
fractions your application uses, instead of relying
on auto-detection, the project includes a set of 
BOMs (bill of materials) which you may use to avoid
having to track and update Maven artifact versions
in several places.

## Different types of BOMs

WildFly Swarm is described as "just enough app-server",
which means it's composed of lots of pieces.  Your application
includes only the pieces it needs.

Over time, some of these pieces have reached "stable" status,
while some are decidedly "unstable" or even "experimental". 
To help segregate the stable from the not-as-stable, different
Maven BOMs may be used.  

* `bom-all`

The `bom-all` BOM includes everything, soup-to-nuts. Anything
that is stable, unstable, experimental, or even deprecated is
included.

* `bom-deprecated`

The `bom-deprecated` BOM includes only those fractions that
have been deprecated.

* `bom-experimental`

The `bom-experimental` BOM includes only those fractions that
are considered experimental. They may disappear or radically change
between releases.

* `bom-unstable`

The `bom-unstable` BOM includes fractions that are better than
experimental, but may still be subject to large changes in their
behaviour, or may contain dangerous or annoying bugs.

* `bom-stable` or `bom`

The `bom-stable` BOM (which is aliased to just `bom` also) contains
those known-good fractions that are recommended for daily use.

* The `bom` artifact

The artifact named `bom` defines all fractions available within
the product.

* The `bom-certified` artifact

The artifact named `bom-certified` defines all _community_ fractions
that have been certified against the product. Any fraction used from
`bom-certified` is unsupported.

.Prerequisites

* A _Maven_-based project with a `pom.xml`

.Procedure

. Include a `bom` artifact in your `pom.xml`

We usually suggest tracking the current version of WildFly Swarm
through a property in your `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
include::{docdir}/pom.xml[tag=property,indent=2]
</properties>
----

In all usage of BOMs with Maven, they are _imported_
into your project through the `<dependencyManagement>`
section.

You must specify the `<type>pom</type>` and `<scope>import</scope>`.

In the example below, we import the `bom` artifact to ensure that
only stable fractions are available.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
include::{docdir}/pom.xml[tag=bom-dependency,indent=4]
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

ifndef::product[] 
If we also wanted to experiment with some unstable fractions
in addition to the stable ones, we would uncomment the `<dependency>`
for `bom-unstable`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
include::{docdir}/pom.xml[tag=bom-dependency,indent=4]
include::{docdir}/pom.xml[tag=bom-unstable-dependency,indent=4]
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

Remember, each flavor of `bom`, with the exception of `bom-all`
contains only the type of fractions indicated.  This allows mixing
and matching the combination of fraction stability that you want
with fine granularity.  If you want both stable and unstable, you
would need to include `bom-stable` (or simply `bom`, which is the same
as `bom-stable`) *and* `bom-unstable`.

endif::[]

[start=2]
. Include WildFly Swarm dependencies

Once you've used the `<dependencyManagement>` section to import
one or more WildFly Swarm BOMs, your application still has *no* 
dependencies on WildFly Swarm artifacts.  All that has been accomplished
is:

* Providing version-management for any WildFly Swarm artifacts you
subsequently *choose* to use.
* Providing support to your IDE for auto-completing known artifacts
while you edit your own `pom.xml`

That being said, now you need to actually include some WildFly Swarm
artifact dependencies, based upon the capabilities your application
requires.

This is done through normal Maven `<dependency>` elements.

Here we include explicit dependencies on the `jaxrs` and `datasources`
fractions, which will provide transitive inclusion of others, such
as `undertow`.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
include::{docdir}/pom.xml[tag=fraction-dependencies,indent=2]
</dependencies>
----

Notice, you have not had to specify the usual `<version>` element
for these `<dependency>` blocks, because the BOM you imported
via `<dependencyManagement>` handles that portion for you.

## Caveats

One short-coming of a Maven BOM import is that it does not
handle `<pluginManagement>`-level configuration.  When you
use the WildFly Swarm Maven Plugin, you still must specify
the version of the plugin to use.

Therefore, since you've used a property within your `pom.xml`
you can still easily ensure that your plugin usage matches
the release of WildFly Swarm that you're targetting with
the BOM import.

[source,xml]
----
<plugins>
  <plugin>
include::{docdir}/pom.xml[tag=plugin,indent=4]
      ...
  </plugin>
</plugins>

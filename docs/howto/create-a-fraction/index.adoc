= How to Create a Fraction

## Introduction

The composable pieces of WildFly Swarm are called _fractions_. Each fraction
starts with a single Maven-addressable artifact which may transitively bring
in others.

## The `pom.xml`

It is useful to set at least a pair of properties, specifying the version
of the WildFly Swarm SPI and fraction-plugin being used:

[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
----
<properties>
  <version.swarm>{version}</version.swarm.spi>
  <version.swarm.fraction-plugin>34</version.swarm.fraction-plugin>
</properties>
----

You can include all of the primary bits of WildFly Swarm using the
`bom-all` artifact in a `<dependencyManagement>` import. Additionally,
you'll need two more dependencies added in order to write CDI components
to configure the server.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>bom-all</artifactId>
      <version>${version.swarm}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.inject</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.inject</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.enterprise</groupId>
    <artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Additionally, the `wildfly-swarm-fraction-plugin` should be configured
within the parent `pom.xml` so that it fires for every sub-module:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-fraction-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${version.swarm.fraction-plugin}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>process-classes</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>process</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

## What's in a Fraction

A "fraction" can include all or none of the following components. Ultimately
a fraction contributes configuration or capabilities to a runtime system.

### Package Layout

For a given fraction, a unique package root is required.  In the usual
case of the core code, it matches the pattern of `org.wildfly.swarm._CAPABILITY_`,
such as `org.wildfly.swarm.undertow` or `org.wildfly.swarm.naming`.

Within the root may be two (or more) additional sub-packages, named
'runtime' and 'deployment'.

The `org.wildfly.swarm._CAPABILITY_.runtime` package holds classes that are
considered "back-end" components, loaded via our internal CDI implementation
in order to configure and setup the server.

The `org.wildfly.swarm._CAPABILITY_.deployment` package holds other classes
that should not be considered either part of the front-end API of the fraction
exposed to users, nor a part of the back-end components to configure the
server.  Instead, the `.deployment` package is a sidecar to hold additional
classes that may be added to deployment archives.

### The `module.conf`

Alongside your `pom.xml` you need at least an empty `module.conf` file to signal
the plugin that your build is actually a fraction.

This file is used to enumerate the JBoss-Modules dependencies your fraction
may have, and helps produce the resulting `module.xml` files for your fraction.

In this file, one per line, you may list the module dependencies you may have.
If your fraction relies on runtime linking to other fractions, they should
typically be listed in this file.

### The `*Fraction.java`

If the fraction includes configuration capabilities, or otherwise alters
the runtime system through deployments or adjustments to the server, it
may include an implementation of `org.wildfly.swarm.spi.api.Fraction`.

Any opaque POJO configuration details that are required may be added in
the implementation, and will be made available to the back-end runtime portion
during server boot-up to control configuration.

In the event that no particular configuration values are required, no
`Fraction` implementation is required.  If provided, it should reside in the
absolute root of the fraction java package, such as `org.wildfly.swarm.undertow.UndertowFraction`.

[source,java]
----
package com.mycorp.cheese;

import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;
import org.wildfly.swarm.spi.api.Fraction;

public class CheeseFraction implements Fraction {
  // arbitrary configuration parameters are allowed

  public void cheese(String type) {
    this.cheeses.add( type );
  }

  public void cheeses(Set<String> types) {
    this.cheeses.addAll( types );
  }

  public Set<String> cheeses() {
    return this.cheeses;
  }

  private Set<String> cheeses = new HashSet<>();
}
----

### Runtime CDI Components

Within the `runtime` sub-package of the fraction, a variety of CDI-enabled
components may be used.  Within these classes, you can use typical CDI mechanisms
such as `@Inject`, `@Produces`, and `Instance<>` in order to accomplish whatever
is required for your fraction.  Typically these components would, at the minimum,
inject their own fraction. They should each be marked as `@ApplicationScoped`.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyComponents implements Whatever {

  @Inject
  private MyFraction myFraction;

}
----

#### `ArchivePreparer`

If your fraction needs an opportunity to alter or otherwise prepare all deployed
archives, you may implement the `org.wildfly.swarm.spi.api.ArchivePreparer` interface.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyArchivePreparer implements ArchivePreparer {

  @Inject
  private MyFraction myFraction;

  public void prepareArchive(Archive<?> archive) {
    archive.as( WARArchive.class ).setContextRoot( myFraction.getContextRoot() );
  }
}
----

#### `ArchiveMetadataProcessor`

If your fraction needs an opportunity to process the Jandex metadata of all deployed
archives, you may implement the `org.wildfly.swarm.spi.api.ArchiveMetadataProcessor`
interface.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyArchiveMetadataProcessor implements ArchiveMetadataProcessor {

  @Inject
  private MyFraction myFraction;

  public void processArchive(Archive<?> archive, Index index) {
    // ...
  }
}

----

#### `Customizer`

Most of the heavy-lifting of configuration may occur within implementations of
`org.wildfly.swarm.spi.api.Customizer`.

If your fraction is always present with other fractions, cross-fraction manipulation
may be achieved.

Two different executions of `Customizers` occur.  All customizers annotated with
`@Pre` are fired, followed by all annotated with `@Post`.

[source,java]
----
@Post
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCustomizer implements Customizer {

  @Inject
  private MyFraction myFraction;

  @Inject
  private UndertowFraction undertowFraction;

  public void customize() {
    if ( undertowHasSSL() ) {
      doSomethingSpecialWithMyFraction()
    }
  }
}
----

#### `Archive` producers

In some cases, a fraction implicitly produces a deployment archive by its simple
presence in the dependency graph.  For example, including `org.wildfly.swarm:jolokia`
ensures that the Jolokia web-app is deployed.  This is accomplished by having a CDI
component that `@Produces` a ShrinkWrap `Archive`.  No particular interface is required
to be implemented.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public MyArchiveProducers {

  @Inject
  private MyFraction myFraction;

  @Produces
  Archive myManagementConsole() {
    WARArchive archive = ...  // produces the Archive any way you like
    archive.setContextRoot( myFraction.getContextRoot() );
    return archive;
  }
}
----

#### `@Configurable` and `Defaultable<>`

When creating a new `Fraction` implementation, each of its fields
will automatically be configurable through the `project-*.yml` 
mechanisms.  In the case that different names for the configurable
items are desired, the `@Configuration` annotation may be used.

Additionally, the `@AttributeDocumentation` annotation should be
used on all fields in order to provide documentation, both
in the reference-guide and through the `--config-help` commandline
capabilities.

[source,java]
----
@Configurable("swarm.myfraction.taco")
@AttributeDocumentation("Determines the type of taco to expose.")
private String tacoType;
----

In the event that there should be a default value provided if the
user provides none, the `Defaultable<T>` type is useful.  The class
also provided type-safe static method for initializing the defaultable
item.

[source,java]
----
@Configurable("swarm.myfraction.taco")
@AttributeDocumentation("Determines the type of taco to expose.")
private Defaultable<String> tacoType = Defaultable.string("soft");
----

Each of these may also be applied to fields within `ArchivePreparer`,
`ArchiveMetadataProcessor`, and `Customizer` implementations.  By default,
no fields from these items will be considered configurable unless explicitly
marked as `@Configurable`.

Generally speaking, it is easier to push all configurable bits to the
related `*Fraction` implementation, and `@Inject` the fraction into
the relevant CDI components.

### Auto-detection

An important point of WildFly Swarm is the capability of the plugin
to autodetect that a fraction is required.  Currently this is only supported
by fractions that are part of the core WildFly Swarm distribution. In
the event that your fraction is merged into core, you will want to possibly
also support auto-detection.

This is accomplished by placing detection logic classes within the
`.detect.*` subpackage of your fraction.

This functionality is still evolving, and thus not terribly well documented
yet.

An example of detecting a fraction (in this case the Batch JBeret fraction)
based on application usage of a given API:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.swarm.batch.jberet.detect;

import org.wildfly.swarm.spi.meta.PackageFractionDetector;

public class BatchPackageDetector extends PackageFractionDetector {

    public BatchPackageDetector() {
        anyPackageOf("javax.batch");
    }

    @Override
    public String artifactId() {
        return "batch-jberet";
    }
}
----

### Transitive dependencies

If your fraction depends upon the presence of a Servlet container being
configured, you should add a dependency on the necessary fractions into
your `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

By doing this, a user must only include your fraction, and the Undertow
fraction will be dragged along implicitly into their application.

### Logging

Each fraction should use the `jboss-logging` framework along with
the appropriate plugins to enable localization.

Include the following `<dependency>` items within your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jboss.logging</groupId>
  <artifactId>jboss-logging-annotations</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jboss.logging</groupId>
  <artifactId>jboss-logging-processor</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
----

Each fraction that requires logging should then include a related
`*Messages` class akin to:

[source,java]
----
@MessageLogger(projectCode = "WFSMYFRAC", length = 4)
public interface MyFractionMessages extends BasicLogger {

    MyFractionMessages MESSAGES = Logger.getMessageLogger(MyFractionMessages.class, "org.wildfly.swarm.myfraction");

    @LogMessage(level = Logger.Level.ERROR)
    @Message(id = 1, value = "Error eating a taco: %s.")
    void errorEatingTaco(String tacoDescriptor, @Cause Throwable t);

}
----

Now, typesafe logging may occur such as 

[source,java]
----
try {
  ...
} catch (TacoException t) {
  MyFractionMessages.MESSAGES.errorEatingTaco("crunchy", t);
}
----

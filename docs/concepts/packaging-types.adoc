= Packaging Types (Uberjars & Hollow Jars)

When using WildFly Swarm, you have two different ways to package your
runtime and application, depending on how you intend to use and deploy
it.

## Uberjar

An _uberjar_ is a single Java `.jar` file that includes everything that
is required to execute your application.  This includes both the selected
runtime components (the parts you may consider to be the _app server_)
along with the application compoments (you `.war`).

An uberjar is useful for many continuous-integration/continuous-deployment (CI/CD)
pipeline styles, in which a single runnable binary artifact is produced 
and moved through your organization's testing, validation and production
environments.

The uberjars produced by WildFly Swarm include the name of your application,
along with the suffix of `-swarm.jar`.

An uberjar can be executed as any executable JAR:

    $ java -jar myapp-swarm.jar

## Hollow Jar

A _hollow jar_ is similar to the _uberjar_ above, but includes _only_
the runtime components, and does _not_ include your application code.
When using a hollow jar, you must provide the application `.war` file
as an argument on the command-line when executing.

A hollow jar works well for deployment processes that involve Linux
containers such as Docker. When using containers, you may wish to place
the runtime components on a lower container image which remains more
consistent, while allowing quicker rebuilds of the higher layer which
contains only your application code.

The hollow jars produced by WildFly Swarm include the name of the
application, along with the suffix of `-hollowswarm.jar`. You must
retain your `.war` application separately in order to benefit from
the hollow jar.

To execute a hollow jar with your application, simply pass the path
to your `.war` on the commandline:

    $ java -jar myapp-hollowswarm.jar myapp.war

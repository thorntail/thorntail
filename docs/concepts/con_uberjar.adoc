= Uberjar

An _uberjar_ is a single Java `.jar` file that includes everything you need to execute your application.
This means both the runtime components you have selected--you can understand that as the app server--along with the application components (your `.war` file).

An uberjar is useful for many continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline styles, in which a single executable binary artifact is produced and moved through the testing, validation, and production environments in your organization.

The names of the uberjars that {Thorntail} produces include the name of your application and the `-thorntail.jar` suffix.

An uberjar can be executed like any executable JAR:

[source]
----
$ java -jar myapp-thorntail.jar
----

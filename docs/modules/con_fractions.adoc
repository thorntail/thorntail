= Fractions

{Thorntail} is defined by an unbounded set of capabilities.
Each piece of functionality is called a _fraction._
Some fractions provide only access to APIs, such as JAX-RS or CDI; other fractions provide higher-level capabilities, such as integration with RHSSO (Keycloak).

The typical method for consuming {Thorntail} fractions is through Maven coordinates, which you add to the `pom.xml` file in your application.
The functionality the fraction provides is then packaged with your application (see xref:creating-an-uberjar_{context}[]).

To enable easier consumption of {Thorntail} fractions, a bill of materials (BOM) is available. For more information, see xref:using-a-bom_{context}[].

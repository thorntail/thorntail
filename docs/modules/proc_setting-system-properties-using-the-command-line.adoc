= Setting system properties using the command line

Setting properties using the Maven plugin is useful for temporarily changing a configuration item for a single execution of your {Thorntail} application.

You can customize an environment-specific setting or experiment with configuration items before setting them in a YAML configuration file.

To use a property on the command line, pass it as a command-line parameter to the Java binary:

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* A JAR file with your application

[discrete]
== Procedure

. In a terminal application, navigate to the directory with your application JAR file.
. Execute your application JAR file using the Java binary and specify the property and its value:
+
--
[source,shell]
----
$ java -Dthorntail.bind.address=127.0.0.1 -jar myapp-thorntail.jar
----

In this example, you assing the value `127.0.0.1` to the property called `thorntail.bind.address`.

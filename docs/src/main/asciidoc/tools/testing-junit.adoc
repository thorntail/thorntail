= Testing with JUnit

{project_name} provides a JUnit `TestRunner` implementation which allows your JUnit tests to execute within the context of your full application.
To use the `TestRunner`, you must include the `testing` artifact with `<scope>test</scope>`.

.Maven Coordinates

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>{groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>{project_key}-testing</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

.Use the `ThorntailRunner``

Write your JUnit test as usual, but include a class-level annotation of `@RunWith(ThorntailRunner.class)`

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(ThorntailRunner.class)
public class MyTest {
  // tests go here 
}
----

.Participate in CDI

Your test class will be instantiated and injected for each test method. 
You may use `@Inject` to inject any component available to your application.
The entirety of your application will be booted and available.

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(ThorntailRunner.class)
public class MyTest {

  public void testSomething() throws Exception {
    assertThat(myLunch.getCheese()).isEqualTo("cheddar");
  }

  @Inject
  private Lunch myLunch;
}
----

.Use `@EphemeralPorts`

If the annotation `@EphemeralPorts` is applied at the class level, and your application uses a servlet container, then arbitrary emphemeral ports will be selected and used.
This may be useful when running tests on a CI machine or if you wish to parallelize your tests.

In order to know what port are actually selected and in-use, you may `@Inject` either a `@Primary` or `@Management` `URL` or `InetSocketAddress` component.
These instances are made available through the xref:component-servlet[Servlet] component.

.assertj

The `testing` artifact transitively brings in http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/index.html[assertj] for making fluent assertions in your tests.

.RestAssured

The `testing` artifact transitively brings in http://rest-assured.io/[RestAssured] to enable easily testing of HTTP endpoints. 
Additionally, it preconfigures the `RestAssured.baseURI` to the URL for the primary web endpoint, if available.
The preconfiguration of the `baseURI` is especially useful when you use `@EphemeralPorts`.

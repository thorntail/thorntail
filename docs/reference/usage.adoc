= `usage.txt`

Each WildFly Swarm application may contain a text file at one of the following locations:

* `/usage.txt`
* `/META-INF/usage.txt`
* `/WEB-INF/usage.txt`

If found, once the application has fully started, then the file will be logged with variable substitution from the configuration properties.

== Variable substitution

Variables within the `usage.txt` file of the format `${swarm.thing}` will be replaced with their current value.  
This may be useful for display the currently active port used by the application, for instance by having content such as:

[source,text]
----
The application is now ready on ${swarm.http.port}!
----

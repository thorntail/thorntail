= Configuring a {Thorntail} application

You can configure numerous options with applications built with {Thorntail}.
For most options, reasonable defaults are already applied, so you do not have to change any options unless you explicitly want to.

This reference is a complete list of all configurable items, grouped by the fraction that introduces them.
Only the items related to the fractions that your application uses are relevant to you.

[id='configuring-a-thorntail-application-using-yaml-files_{context}']
== YAML files

YAML is the preferred method for long-term configuration of your application.
In addition to that, the YAML strategy provides grouping of environment-specific configurations, which you can selectively enable when executing the application.
